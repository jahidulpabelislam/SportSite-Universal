# SportSite Universal

During 1st year of college (2012) I had to create a website. I decided to create a informational site for sports and events around the world.

I first thought of the idea for the site then went onto design the pages required. Then I developed the site using HTML4 & CSS3.

A basic site including images, videos, tables, lists.
