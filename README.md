# SportSite Universal

During the 1st year of college (2012) I was tasked to create a basic website to showcase my skills. So I decided to create an informational site for sports and events around the world. This is just a  basic site that includes images, videos, tables & lists.

I first thought of the idea for the site then went on to design the pages required. Lastly actually developed the site.

The site was developed using HTML4 & CSS3.
